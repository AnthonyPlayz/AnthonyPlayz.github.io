        <h2>The Escapists</h2>
        <p>This action packed game is a favourite for gamers. If you want to win, you got to have knowledge. Here's what others think about this game. "Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth most people's time and cash" - Destructoid. From my perspective, this game is an 7.5 out of 10 to me. </p>

         <h2>Terraria</h2>
         <p>This indie sandbox game is much more than a 2D version of Minecraft. It is a game with a wide variety of items, people and resources. It can get frustrating at time but it is addicting like hell! "Between building, battling, and exploring, there's an absurd amount of stuff to do. Once you dig into it, you won't want to stop playing" says IGN. I would give it an 9 out of 10. </p>
